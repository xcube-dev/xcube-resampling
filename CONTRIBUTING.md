**PR checklist**

* Format and check code using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) with 
  default settings: `ruff format` and `ruff check`. See also section 
  [code style](#code-style) below.
* Your change shall not break existing unit tests.
  `pytest` must run without errors.
* Add unit tests for any new code not yet covered by tests.
* Make sure test coverage stays close to 100% for any change.
  Use `pytest --cov=xarray_eopf --cov-report=html` to verify.

## Code style

The code style of xarray-eopf equals the default settings 
of [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/). Since black is 
un-opinionated regarding the order of imports, we group and 
sort imports statements according to the default settings of 
[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) which boils down to

0. Future imports
1. Python standard library imports, e.g., `os`, `typing`, etc
2. 3rd-party imports, e.g., `xarray`, `zarr`, etc
3. 1st-party library module imports using absolute paths, 
   e.g., `from xarray_eopf.a.b.c import d`. 
4. 1st-party library module imports from local modules: 
   Relative imports such as `from .c import d` are ok
   while `..c import d` are not ok.

Use `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` to resolve forward references 
and effectively avoid circular dependencies.

Package classes, functions, constants, type aliases considered public API 
should have docstrings according to the 
[Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
