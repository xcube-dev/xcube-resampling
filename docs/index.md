# xcube-resampling

**xcube-resampling** provides efficient algorithms for transforming datasets into 
different spatial grid mappings. It is designed for geospatial workflows that need 
flexible resampling and reprojection.

### âœ¨ Features
- **Affine resampling** â€“ simple resampling using affine transformations  
- **Reprojection** â€“ convert datasets between different coordinate reference systems (CRS)  
- **Rectification** â€“ transform irregular grids into regular, well-structured grids  

All methods work seamlessly with chunked (lazily loaded) [xarray.Datasets](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html) and are powered by [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) for scalable, out-of-core computation.

### âš¡ Lightweight & Independent
The package is independent of the core *xcube* framework and has minimal dependencies:
`affine, dask, dask-image, numba, numpy, pyproj, xarray, zarr`.


## Overview

The resampling methods are built around the
[`GridMapping`](api.md/#xcube_resampling.gridmapping.GridMapping)
class, which represents a spatial grid mapping and contains all necessary information
for resampling.  

A `GridMapping` is required for affine transformation and reprojection, and optional
for rectification. If omitted for rectification, a simple rectification will be
performed while staying in the same CRS.

### `resample_in_space` â€” the gateway to xcube-resampling

The **central function** in this package is
[`resample_in_space`](api.md/#xcube_resampling.spatial.resample_in_space),
which integrates all three algorithms and **automatically selects** the appropriate one
based on the criteria below.

| Algorithm             | Function                                                                               | Selection Criteria                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Affine Transformation** | [`affine_transform_dataset`](api.md/#xcube_resampling.affine.affine_transform_dataset) | Source and target grids are both regular and share the same CRS.                                    |
| **Reprojection**      | [`reproject_dataset`](api.md/#xcube_resampling.reproject.reproject_dataset)            | Source and target grids are both regular but have different CRS.                                    |
| **Rectification**     | [`rectify_dataset`](api.md/#xcube_resampling.rectify.rectify_dataset)                  | Source grid is irregular and contains 2D coordinates.                                               |

With `resample_in_space`, users do **not** need to worry about selecting the right
algorithmâ€”the function determines and applies it automatically.
