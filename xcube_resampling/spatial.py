    Resample the spatial dimensions of a dataset to match a target grid mapping.

    Depending on the regularity and compatibility of the source and target grid
    mappings, this function will either rectify, reproject, or affine-transform the
    spatial dimensions of `source_ds`.

    Args:
        source_ds: The input xarray.Dataset. Data variables must have dimensions
            in the following order: optional third dimension followed by the
            y-dimension (e.g., "y" or "lat") and the x-dimension (e.g., "x" or "lon").
        target_gm: The target GridMapping to which the dataset should be resampled.
            Must be regular. If not provided, a default regular grid is derived
            from `source_gm` using `to_regular(tile_size)`.
        source_gm: The GridMapping describing the source dataset's spatial layout.
            If not provided, it is inferred from `source_ds` using
            `GridMapping.from_dataset(source_ds)`.
        variables: A single variable name or iterable of variable names to be
            resampled. If None, all data variables will be processed.
        interp_methods: Optional interpolation method to be used for upsampling spatial
            data variables. Can be a single interpolation method for all variables or a
            dictionary mapping variable names or dtypes to interpolation method.
            Supported methods include:

            - `0` (nearest neighbor)
            - `1` (linear / bilinear)
            - `"nearest"`
            - `"triangular"`
            - `"bilinear"`

            The default is `0` for integer arrays, else `1`.
        agg_methods: Optional aggregation methods for downsampling spatial variables.
            Can be a single method for all variables or a dictionary mapping variable
            names or dtypes to methods. Supported methods include:
                "center", "count", "first", "last", "max", "mean", "median",
                "mode", "min", "prod", "std", "sum", and "var".
            Defaults to "center" for integer arrays, else "mean".
        recover_nans: Optional boolean or mapping to enable NaN recovery during
            upsampling (only applies when interpolation method is not nearest).
            Can be a single boolean or a dictionary mapping variable names or dtypes
            to booleans. Defaults to False.
        fill_values: Optional fill value(s) for areas outside input coverage.
            Can be a single value or dictionary by variable or type. If not provided,
            defaults based on data type are used:

            - float: NaN
            - uint8: 255
            - uint16: 65535
            - other ints: -1

        tile_size: Optional tile size used when generating a regular grid from
            an irregular source grid mapping. Only used if `target_gm` is not provided.

    Returns:
        A new dataset that has been spatially resampled to match the target grid
            mapping.

    Notes:
        - If `source_gm` is not provided, it is inferred from `source_ds`.
        - If `target_gm` is not provided, and the source is irregular, it is
          derived from `source_gm.to_regular(tile_size=tile_size)`.
        - If both grid mappings are regular and approximately equal, the original
          dataset is returned unchanged.
        - If the transformation can be represented as an affine mapping, it is
          applied directly for performance.
        - If the source is irregular, rectification is applied.
        - Otherwise, a reprojection is performed.
        - See the [xcube-resampling documentation](https://xcube-dev.github.io/xcube-resampling/)
          for more details.
